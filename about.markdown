With my professional career background with the Agricultural Development Bank for more than 25 years, now I am trying to pursue my own passion for growing herbal plants and keeping our environment clean.  

After retirement in late 2004, I began working with my wife who has lifetime experience in growing special plants and vegetables. Now, we are opening “P&B Greenery” to generate interest in a wide variety of special plants and vegetables, especially medicinal plants and distribute to our community to promote awareness of benefit from medicinal plants. This will help in two-fold one is to promote greenery and other is to help our environment. 
The practice of using herbal supplements dates back thousands of years. But that practice is decreasing due to modern medicine.  Alternative medicine has made its way into the mainstream, even finding a home on the lifestyle blogs of celebrities and common people. More and more people are exploring the healing possibilities of plant-based medicines, and health shops now stock their shelves with natural remedies, but treatments can easily be made at home. There are thousand of plants which could be used for diet and healing. 

Our main purpose is to promote “Green Revolution in our community” which will help to keep our environment clean and growing our own herbals and being self-sufficient with vegetable for our consumption and avoid pesticide used market vegetables.
